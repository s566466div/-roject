# npm resolution error report

While resolving: @angular-devkit/build-angular@17.3.6
Found: protractor@5.4.1
node_modules/protractor
  dev protractor@"~5.4.0" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peerOptional protractor@"^7.0.0" from @angular-devkit/build-angular@17.3.6
node_modules/@angular-devkit/build-angular

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
